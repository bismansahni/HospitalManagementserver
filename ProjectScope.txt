## Project Title
**Basic Hospital Management System**

## Project Overview
A simplified web-based hospital management system designed to manage basic operations such as patient registration, doctor schedules, and appointments. This system will allow for essential management tasks while keeping the implementation manageable for a solo developer.

## Functional Requirements

### User Authentication and Authorization
- **Admin:** Manage doctors and patients, oversee appointments.
- **Doctor:** View their schedules and patient appointments.
- **Patient:** Book appointments and view their own appointment history.

### Patient Management
- Add and update patient records.
- View patient details.

### Doctor Management
- Add and update doctor profiles.
- Manage doctor schedules (availability).

### Appointment Management
- Book, update, and cancel appointments.
- View available time slots for doctors.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Security
- Basic authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Data encryption for sensitive information.

### Performance
- Efficient handling of basic CRUD operations.

### Usability
- Simple and user-friendly interface for all user roles.

## Technologies and Tools

### Backend:
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB

### Frontend:
- React.js
- Bootstrap or Material-UI for styling

### Additional Tools:
- JWT for authentication
- Nodemailer for email notifications (optional)

## Development Milestones

### Phase 1: Planning and Design
- Requirement gathering and analysis.
- Design the system architecture.
- Create wireframes and UI mockups.

### Phase 2: Backend Development
- Set up the Node.js and Express server.
- Implement user authentication and authorization.
- Develop the patient, doctor, and appointment management modules.

### Phase 3: Frontend Development
- Set up the React.js project.
- Develop the user interfaces for admin, doctor, and patient roles.
- Integrate frontend with backend APIs.

### Phase 4: Testing and Deployment
- Perform basic testing for functionality.
- Deploy the application on a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, Vercel).

## Expected Outcomes

- A functional web application that handles basic hospital operations efficiently.
- Demonstration of your ability to design and develop a full-stack application.
- A comprehensive understanding of Node.js, Express, MongoDB, React.js, and related technologies.
